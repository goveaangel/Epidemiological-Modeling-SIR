# SIR Model: Simulating Epidemic Dynamics

## üìå Project Overview
This project implements the **SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model** to simulate the spread of infections in different geographic scenarios. The study is divided into multiple phases, incorporating epidemiological modeling, population movement, and vaccination strategies.

## üìä Dataset & Simulations
We designed a simulated population distributed in different city geometries and modeled the spread of an infection using differential equations. The project explores:
- **Phase 1**: Basic SIR model without movement.
- **Phase 2**: Extended model with birth and death rates.
- **Phase 3**: Population movement and cluster-based infection dynamics.
- **Phase 4**: Dynamic simulation with animation, integrating a vaccination strategy.

## üî¨ Methodology
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ SIR Model Formulation
The SIR model is based on the following differential equations:

$$
\frac{dS}{dt} = - \beta \frac{I}{N} S
$$

$$
\frac{dI}{dt} = \beta \frac{I}{N} S - \gamma I
$$

$$
\frac{dR}{dt} = \gamma I
$$

where:
- **S**: Susceptible individuals
- **I**: Infected individuals
- **R**: Recovered individuals
- **Œ≤**: Infection rate
- **Œ≥**: Recovery rate
- **N**: Total population

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Phase-Based Enhancements
- **Phase 1**: Simulated a closed population with no external factors affecting the infection dynamics.
- **Phase 2**: Introduced birth and death rates, adjusting the model for demographic changes.
- **Phase 3**: Implemented movement dynamics in different city geometries (grid-based and clustered populations).
- **Phase 4**: Developed an animated simulation with **ggAnimate**, allowing visualization of disease spread in real time.

## üöÄ Key Findings
- Infection peaks depend on **R0 (basic reproduction number)**, calculated as:

  R_0 = Œ≤ / Œ≥

- Vaccination strategies can prevent outbreaks if at least **75% of the population is immunized**.
- Mobility and clustering significantly impact how an infection spreads, altering the effectiveness of containment measures.

## üèÜ Project Impact
This project provides insights into **epidemiological modeling** and how different variables affect disease spread. The simulation framework can be extended to model **real-world pandemics**, including the impact of interventions like vaccination and quarantine.
